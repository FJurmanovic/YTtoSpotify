# YTtoSpotify
YTtoSpotify is a chrome extension written in javascript that uses [Youtube API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) and [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) that was meant for easily adding songs to my spotify liked songs from youtube. Everything was working until I found out that spotify api token loses permissions after 1 hour. But nonetheless, It was really fun project to do, and I was really happy that it worked for, at least, that one hour.
